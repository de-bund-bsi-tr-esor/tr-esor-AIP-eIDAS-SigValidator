cli.info=\n\nThe XAIPValidator includes multiple functions which can be executed. Those functions are\: finding signatures, verify signatures, validating an XAIP. Those functions can be used by passing the corresponding option. Finding and verifying signatures can be applied to different validation targets which are listed below. When no function is selected the XAIP will only be validated. Using one of the other functions already includes the XAIP validation. Validation targets\: a - ASiC, c - CAdES, p - PAdES, t - TSP, x - XAdES
cli.name=java -jar xaip-validator-cli.jar
cli.usage.input=Filepath pointing to an XAIP file to read. Using standard in as default InputStream when this argument is missing or no filepath was proivided. Example\: -in /tmp/sample.xaip
cli.usage.output=File- or directorypath of the output file. The provided path needs to be writeable if it exists. By default the current directory will be used as output directory. Example\: -out /tmp/result.xml
cli.usage.ecard.url=The eCard URL. Example\: http\://localhost\:8080/sample/url
cli.usage.verify=Verifies the signatures of the provided validation target arguments. When no target is being provided, all signatures will be verified. Example\: verify -t\=xcp
cli.usage.target=Targets which should be considered when calling a function. When multiple targets are being passed to a function, the types can be concatinated in any order. Possible validation targets are\: PAdES(p), CAdES(c), ASiC(a), XAdES(x), TSP(t). Example call\: -t\=xcp
cli.usage.help=Printing this help page.
