cli.info=\n\nThe XAIPValidator includes multiple functions which can be executed. Those functions are\: finding signatures, verify signatures, validating an XAIP. Those functions can be used by passing the corresponding option. Finding and verifying signatures can be applied to different validation targets which are listed below. When no function is selected the XAIP will only be validated. Using one of the other functions already includes the XAIP validation. Validation targets\: a - ASiC, c - CAdES, p - PAdES, t - TSP, x - XAdES
cli.name=java -jar xaip-validator-cli.jar
cli.usage.input=Filepath pointing to an XAIP file to read. Using standard in as default InputStream when this argument is missing or no filepath was proivided. Example\: -in /tmp/sample.xaip
cli.usage.output=File- or directorypath of the output file. The provided path needs to be writeable if it exists. By default the current directory will be used as output directory. Example\: -out /tmp/result.xml
cli.usage.ecard.url=The eCard URL. Example\: http\://localhost\:8080/sample/url
cli.usage.verify=Verifies the signatures of the provided XAIP using the configured signatureFinder- and signatureVerifierModule. Since each module has it's own implementation it's possible they don't support all types of signatures. Take a look into the specification of those module implementations for more informations.
cli.usage.help=Printing this help page.
